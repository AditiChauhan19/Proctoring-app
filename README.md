# Proctoring-app
Focus &amp; Object Detection in Video Interviews is a web-based proctoring system using TensorFlow.js for real-time monitoring. It detects focus loss, multiple/absent faces, and suspicious objects (phone, books). Events are logged with timestamps, and reports (CSV/PDF) with integrity scores are generated for fair online assessments.
